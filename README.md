Project of the Software Engineering course, made by a group of 4 people in <a href='https://www.javascript.com/' target='_blank'>Javascript</a> with the <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank'>VsCode</a> IDE on the <a href='https://about.gitlab.com/' target='_blank'>GitLab</a> platform. The project included a first phase of adding/modifying some features in a partial implementation of an application to manage expenses (EzWallet). Then there was a phase of <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/14lXYJNWTPCpCQtvYtTHd8U33XFJr5By4/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>testing</a> of the implemented features, both with unit test and integration test. The project was finally put on <a href='https://www.docker.com/' target='_blank'>docker</a> to test its functionality in a preconfigured environment.

### Brief Project Description
EZWallet is a web application designed to help individuals and families keep track of their 
expenses. Users can enter and categorize their expenses, allowing them to quickly see where their 
money is going. EZWallet is a powerful tool for those looking to take control of their finances and 
make informed decisions about their spending.
