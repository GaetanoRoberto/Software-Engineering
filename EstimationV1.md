# Project Estimation - CURRENT
Date: 14/04/2023

Version:
| Version number | Change |
| ----------------- |:-----------|
| 1.0 | Estimation by Size, Product Decomposition, Activity Decomposition |

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |             54                |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |             13               | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 702 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |           70.2                           |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 2.106 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |         0.43875           |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
